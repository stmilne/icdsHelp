# Accounts

Access to Roar Collab requires an account.
All RC account holders are provided an allotment of [storage space](10_FileStorage.md/#quotas),
access to the Portal, 
and access to vintage hardware via the [open queue](08_BatchJobs.md/#queues).

[Roar Restricted](15_RoarRestricted.md) accounts 
are only for users working with sensitive data
requiring extra security provisions.


## PSU affiliates

Anyone with a Penn State access ID can request an account on Roar Collab.
Students and postdocs must be sponsored by a Penn State faculty member 
(their supervisor, advisor or collaborator). 

To request an account, fill out the online application [here](https://accounts.hpc.psu.edu/users/#).

## Sponsored accounts

Penn State faculty can set up [sponsored access accounts][sponsored]
for external collaborators, 
which provides them with a Penn State access account and email address.
Once the sponsored access account is active, a Roar Collab account can be requested.

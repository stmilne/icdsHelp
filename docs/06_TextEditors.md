# Text editors

Unix is a text-based operating system;
programs, batch scripts, and parameter files are text files.
To work on Unix, you need a good text editor.  There are several options.  

`gedit` is a modern windows-style text editor,
with cursor / mouse / cut-and-paste / menus,
reasonably intuitive for Windows and Mac users.

`vi` is beloved by old-school users (or those who appreciate old-school wisdom).
It is "visual" in that you can see the contents of the file.
However, you move around not with cursor and mouse, but by key commands.
`vi` offers powerful search-and-replace functions,
and rapid navigation within the file.
Learning `vi` is like learning to touch-type -- 
difficult at first, but remarkably fast.  

Tutorials for `vi` are available [here][vi1], [here][vi2], and [here][vi3].
Once you know `vi`, [this summary][vi_summary] is useful.

Files can be edited on the laptop and transferred to the cluster.
If you do this, you must use a text editor, not a word processor,
which introduces hidden characters that make a mess.
On the Mac, use BBEdit, available [here](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/);
on the PC, the best alternative is Notepad++, available [here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org).

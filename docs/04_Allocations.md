# Allocations

To submit batch jobs on any but [vintage](02_RoarHardware.md) hardware, 
a paid allocation is required.
Faculty can set up allocations, for one or more groups or projects,
with a list of approved users, funded by a given source.

Allocations are "pay as you go":
the account is charged only when compute jobs run.
Jobs are priced in "compute units" (CUs). 
One CU equals one core-month on a basic node.

CUs from an allocation can be spent on any type of node,
so that you can use whatever hardware is needed for a given job.

The prices of different nodes (basic, standard, hi-memory, GPU)
are proportional to the capital cost of the hardware,
and competitive with the cost of buying your own cluster.

| resource | price | ratio | 5-year node cost |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| basic | $2.70 | 1 | $10,358 |
| standard | $5.06 | 1.88 | $14,585 |
| hi-memory | $7.66 | 2.84 | $22,048 | 
| A100 GPU | $237.97 | 88.22 | $28,556 |
| P100 GPU | $98.13 | 36.38 | N/A |

In the above table, prices are per "core-month"
for CPU nodes (basic, standard, and hi-memory).
For GPU nodes, the price is per "GPU-month",
which includes the GPU's share of the CPUs.

The "5-year node cost" is the total cost at these rates
of five years on a single node,
which can be compared to the purchase price of a node.

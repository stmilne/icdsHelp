# Login accounts

Access to Roar Collab requires a login account.
All login account holders are provided 
an allotment of [storage space](10_FileStorage.md/#quotas),
and free access to the Portal as well as vintage hardware 
via the [open queue](08_BatchJobs.md/#queues).
The same login works for SSH access as well.

[Roar Restricted](16_RoarRestricted.md) login accounts 
are only for users working with sensitive data
requiring extra security provisions.


## PSU

Anyone with a Penn State access ID
can request an account on Roar Collab.
Students and postdocs must be sponsored by a Penn State faculty member 
(their supervisor, advisor or collaborator). 

To request an account, fill out the online application 
[here](https://accounts.hpc.psu.edu/users/#).
Once granted, your login account uses the same access ID and password
as your Penn State email.


## Non-PSU

Penn State faculty can set up [sponsored access accounts][sponsored]
for external collaborators, 
which provides them with a Penn State access account and email address.
Once the sponsored access account is active, a Roar Collab account can be requested.
